# Benchmark Model Electrical Network
This repository contains the documentation for the electrical network benchmark model developed in the ERIGrid 2.0 project. 

The folder "Matlab Implementation Files" includes the Matlab/Simulink implementation of the two versions (dynamic and phasor) of the model. 
The document "ListofFiles.pdf" provides a short description of each modelling file.

The folder "PreCISE Documentation" contains the description of the model according to the PreCISE framework. 
The different subfolders are indexed according to the PreCISE template and the file "PreCISE_ToC.pdf" provides a brief description of each file.
